# Samples for the Content API for Shopping

These code samples are organized by platform or language. The Installed application method is used for authentication in all the samples.

For more information on the API, please refer to [the documentation](https://developers.google.com/shopping-content/).

There are currently two languages with samples, Java and PHP. These require the appropriate client library, which can be found at the [client libraries page](https://developers.google.com/shopping-content/v2/libraries).

The samples are command-line applications and require you to create a file called `.shopping-content-samples.json` in your home directory. You can use the `config.json` file here as a template.
